1.  **What was the bug?**

    The bug was that the `calculateSum` function received the input values for `num1` and `num2` from the HTML input fields as **strings**, not as numbers. For example, instead of getting the number `10`, it received the string `"10"`. When the `+` operator was used inside the function (`let result = num1 + num2`), it performed string concatenation on these string values rather than arithmetic addition. Consequently, adding `"10"` and `"10"` resulted in the string `"1010"` instead of the expected numerical sum of `20`. This incorrect concatenated string was then displayed as the sum on the webpage.



2.  **How would you fix it?**

    To fix the bug, the string values stored in the `num1` and `num2` variables need to be converted to actual numbers before the addition operation is performed. This can be done using built-in JavaScript functions like `parseInt()` (to convert to an integer) or `Number()` (to convert to a number, including decimals).

    The fix involves changing the line inside the `calculateSum` function where `result` is calculated. Instead of:
    `let result = num1 + num2;`

    It should be modified to explicitly convert the inputs to numbers first, for example:
    `let result = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);`


    This ensures that the `+` operator performs arithmetic addition on numerical values, producing the correct sum (e.g., `10 + 10 = 20`) instead of string concatenation.
